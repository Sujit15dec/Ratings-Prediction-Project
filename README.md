# Rating Prediction Project
Ratings are an important metric in e-commerce application to determine a product’s quality, consumer demand, worth and profitability. The sentiment of a user towards a product is reflected in their rating score and their review of the product. This helps determine how the product is perceived by the consumers and in turn gives an idea about the acceptance of the product by the consumers. There is a strong positive correlation between the rating of a product and its consumer demand. Therefore, it is necessary to build a predictive model which can, with good accuracy predict what rating a user might give a particular product based on the user review. This helps understand user sentiment towards a product and determine the product’s worth and acceptance by consumers.
